# morse_code_project
group project for python class

'main.py' is a program that can encrypts and decrypts texts. Please provide following arguments in console (after script name):
       1. 'E' - for encrypting or 'D' - for decrypting.
       2. 'C' - for Caesar cipher or  'M' for Morse code. 
       3. shift for Caesar cipher (integer number) - in case of Morse code provide any integer
       4. 'path/text_file_name.txt' (it could be only same name of file but file needs to be stored in the same folder as script) - please remember that text should        contain only spaces and lowercase letters from English alphabet.
       
       
The output from transformation will be saved in file 'output.txt' in the same folder that script file is stored.

The program was tested on file 'lorem_ipsum.txt' stored in repository.
